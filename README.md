# NITA Robot 23.12

Welcome to NITA, an open source platform for automating the building and testing of complex networks.

# Release Notes
The major change in this version is that all components now run within pods under the control of Kubernetes, rather than as Docker containers. Consequently we have updated the way that Robot runs because it is now controlled by Kubernetes instead of Docker. 

Please refer to the [README][readme] for more details.

# Installing

The simplest way to install nita-robot is by installing nita, which can be done by running the ``install.sh`` script located and in the parent [nita repo][branch] as described [here][readme].

## Accessing the container

You can access the nita-robot container via the shell, simply be running the following command:

```
user@host$ nita-cmd robot cli
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
nita-robot:~# exit
exit
pod "nita-robot" deleted
user@host$
```
